  {
    q: "What are research peptides?",
    a: "Research peptides are short chains of amino acids used exclusively in laboratory and scientific research settings. They serve as tools for studying biological processes, receptor interactions, and metabolic pathways. All NOVARYN peptides are supplied as lyophilized powder for research use only.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are NOVARYN products for human use?",
    a: "No. All NOVARYN products are sold strictly for laboratory and research use only. They are not intended for human or veterinary use, and not for use as a drug, food, dietary supplement, or cosmetic. Every order is subject to our Research Use Only (RUO) compliance terms.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I verify the purity of my batch?",
    a: "Every NOVARYN vial includes a batch code printed on the label. Enter this code on our COA Lookup page to retrieve the full Certificate of Analysis — including HPLC chromatograms, mass spectrometry data, and the independent laboratory report. All COAs are publicly archived and permanently searchable.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is lyophilized powder and how should I store it?",
    a: "Lyophilized powder is a freeze-dried form of the peptide that ensures maximum stability during storage and shipping. We recommend storing unopened vials at −20°C in a frost-free freezer, protected from light. Once reconstituted, peptides should be used promptly and stored according to the specific compound's stability profile.",
  },
  {
    q: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    a: "We accept major credit and debit cards, bank wire transfers, and cryptocurrency payments. All transactions are processed through secure, encrypted gateways. For institutional purchase orders, please contact our support team directly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you ship internationally?",
    a: "Yes. NOVARYN ships to research institutions and laboratories worldwide. Shipping rates and transit times vary by destination. All international orders are subject to local import regulations — it is the buyer's responsibility to ensure compliance with their country's customs and import laws.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is your return policy?",
    a: "Due to the sensitive nature of lyophilized research materials, we cannot accept returns on opened or reconstituted products. If you receive a damaged vial or an incorrect shipment, contact our support team within 72 hours of delivery with photographic documentation, and we will arrange a replacement or refund.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the Lab Affiliate Program work?",
    a: "Our Lab Affiliate Program allows qualifying research institutions and laboratories to earn credit on future orders by referring colleagues. Affiliates receive a unique referral link and trackable dashboard. Contact us or visit the Lab Affiliate page to learn more about eligibility and commission structure.",
